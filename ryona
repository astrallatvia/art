Due to receiving suspension from Patreon because I made this kind of videos, I have to resort to doing this sneaky trick.
Yeah it stupid I know but blame Patreon for restriction creators to do this kind of things even though it clearly a virtual thing.
What the point of them having NSFW category in first place? 
Honestly speaking, Subscriber Star does it way better and I don't receive any warning from them doing this kind of videos.
Also don't worry, I will slowly transition to Google Drive and MEGA soon. 
I understand you guys frustration going to that 'website'. It will take time for me to upload again.

Anyway enough of my rambling, here is the link to my videos.
