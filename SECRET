Due to receiving suspension from Patreon because I made this kind of videos, I have to resort to doing this sneaky trick.
Yeah it stupid I know but blame Patreon for restricting creators to do this kind of things even though it clearly a virtual thing.
What the point of them having NSFW category in first place? 
Honestly speaking, Subscriber Star does it way better and I don't receive any warning from them doing this kind of videos.

Anyway enough of my rambling, here is the link to my videos.

Decryption key is required to download the file. 
If you are not a supporter, don't be a freeloader and support my Patreon. This take me long time to make these things. Link is provided over there.

The links will be updated soon, I just need to reupload the file with trademark because apparently someone dumbass steal my content and post it like its their own video.
